## Introduction

Christianne went to the No Kill Louisville Pet Food Bank on September 3, 2022, from 11:30 a.m. to 2: 40 p.m. The purpose of this visit was to observe the check in and check out process of the pet food giveaway. Another purpose of this team member’s visit was interviewing Rebecca Ficklin who is the current president of the nonprofit organization. The following report is an account of the visit.

### Operations
Lines of cars are lined up by 30 minute incremented appointments from 11a.m – 3:00p.m on every first Saturday of the month. There are usually six parking slots. So, six cars are attended on every 30 minutes. This means that six people can have the same appointment time. 
New volunteers are expected every operation day. According to Rebecca, volunteer numbers are usually between 3-4 people. There is a volunteer at the gate who checks on names and missing documentation if there is any. Other volunteers bring food on carts and put them in the trunk of the pet owners’ vehicles. The last notable volunteer is one with papers containing information on who is expected to come collect pet food. This is done manually by checking off names or denying service to those who are missing documentation.  

## The Bottleneck
	In a nutshell, the bottleneck is the check in and check out process. 
-	Pet owners can have missing documentation in more than one visit
-	Pet owners can be unfriendly
-	Volunteers are usually new and so they usually do not have experience with the process which slows down operations.
-	A lot of paper and pen work is used to check in and check out pet owners.
-	Much time is spent talking with the pet owners.

## What they already have
-	Website
-	App called Acuity Scheduling
## What they Need
-	On the client side: an app that lets pet owners confirm that they have arrived at their appointment time. It should not let them check in if they have arrived before their appointed time. If they come early, they must go in the back of the line. 
-	On the volunteer side:
-	 See live who has confirmed the appointment as the time comes.
-	 See who is missing information using a quick color-coding scheme. 
-	 Flag those who are unfriendly or problematic. 
-	 A different flag for those who are denied service
-	 See who is supposed to be coming even if they have not used the app
-	 Assign a slot number to pet owner
-	 Check out those who have already received pet food.
-	 Information on pets to receive food. 
## What it should look like
Rebecca mentioned that there is an app, like what they want to have, that the developers of might be willing to let us have. We can tweak it and make it fit the purpose of the No Kill Louisville Pet Food Bank. Even if we do not want to use that app, we can get ideas from that for the user interface portion of the app. We have contacted her for more information on this.
## What We Need for Our Next Steps
-	No Kill Louisville system APIs such as the APIs used to build the website and those that are used to store information for the Pet Food Bank.
