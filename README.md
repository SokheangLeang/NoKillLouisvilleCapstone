## About the No Kill Louisville Pet Food Bank 
The No Kill Louisville Pet Food Bank Mobile App is designed to help the No Kill Lousville Pet Food bank on operations day. Operations day is usually the first Saturday of every month. Several willing volunteers welcome pet owners and load their cars with pet food depending on their needs. This is usually a very busy day with few hands to help.
## About the App
The solid purpose of creating this android application is to assist volunteers on operations day. Volunteers are usually very few and very new at the job. The app is easy to use and quick to learn. It also offers a section for pet owners to confirm their appointments when they arrive. The app mainly helps volunteers by:
* showing information about confirmed appointments
* showing paperwork status of pet owners that are present at the appointed time
* giving volunteers the opportunity to rate pet owners coming to pick up food
* giving volunteers the opportunity to leave a note about pet owners coming to pick up food
